Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
1 <= numCourses <= 10^5

Solution

class Solution {
   public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
    int[][] matrix = new int[numCourses][numCourses]; 
    int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
    
    for (int i=0; i<prerequisites.length; i++) {
        int ready = prerequisites[i][0];
        int pre = prerequisites[i][1];
        if (matrix[pre][ready] == 0)
            indegree[ready]++;
        matrix[pre][ready] = 1;
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList();
    for (int i=0; i<indegree.length; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) queue.offer(i);
    }
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int course = queue.poll();
        count++;
        for (int i=0; i<numCourses; i++) {
            if (matrix[course][i] != 0) {
                if (--indegree[i] == 0)
                    queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
    }
    return count == numCourses;
}
}
